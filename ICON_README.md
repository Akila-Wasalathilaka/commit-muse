# Extension Icon

Since we can't generate actual image files, you'll need to create an icon.png file (128x128px) for the extension. 

For now, you can:
1. Create a 128x128px PNG image with the ðŸš€ emoji or Akyyra logo
2. Name it "icon.png" and place it in the root directory
3. Or temporarily remove the "icon" field from package.json

The extension will work without an icon, but it's recommended for publishing.
