## üìã Development Standards

### Code Organization
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.ts          # Main extension entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ panels/              # Webview panels and providers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git/                 # Git operations and management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/                  # AI commit message generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/               # Shared utilities and helpers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                # Test files and test setup
```

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Use explicit types instead of `any`
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for objects
- Use enum for constants with multiple values

### Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log detailed errors for debugging
- Don't expose internal errors to users

### Git Integration
- Use the simple-git library for Git operations
- Handle repository state changes gracefully
- Support repositories in any state (dirty, clean, etc.)
- Respect user's Git configuration

### AI Integration
- Support multiple AI providers
- Handle API failures gracefully
- Respect rate limits and API quotas
- Don't send sensitive information to AI APIs

## üéØ Project Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use without learning curve
- **Performance**: Fast and responsive user experience
- **Reliability**: Works consistently across different Git repositories
- **Accessibility**: Usable by developers with different abilities

### Design Principles
- **VS Code Native**: Feels like part of VS Code
- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't interfere with existing workflows
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features and AI providers
- **Secure**: Handles API keys and data safely
